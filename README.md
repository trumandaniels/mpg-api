# mpg-api
An RESTful API that returns mileage (MPG) and other data on specific cars. I have only tested on linux, but I may add Windows compatibility at a later time.

First (Optional) Step: create and activate python virtual environemnt or anaconda environment first (skipping this step could cause package dependency/compatibility issues if your machine is used for many projects)

## Set Up

Creating python3 virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/VIRTUALENVNAME 
```
Activating the environment:
```
source /path/to/new/virtual/VIRTUALENVNAME/bin/activate
```
note: I am not testing with anaconda but it should still work

Then install neccesary packages to run the scripts
```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt 
```
